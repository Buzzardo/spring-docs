== Spring Framework Overview

Spring provides everything beyond the Java language that a Java developer needs to create an enterprise application. The Spring Framework also lets you go beyond Java, to other languages in the Java family, notably Groovy and Kotlin. The Spring Framework's goal is to provide everything Java developers need on the way to developing an application, even if your project's path goes through Groovy and Kotlin.

The Spring Framework provides the means to create an application, at any level from the hobbyist to the enterprise. The Spring Framework lets Java you create enterprise applications quickly. You can create a small application in minutes. Also, you don't have to know everything about Spring to get started. Spring is designed to let you jump in and get started immediately. {JB: Do we want to mention Spring Boot (and link to it) here? In other words, do we want to stay exclusively with the Framework in this document?} If you want to jump right in and get started, we suggest using Spring Boot and creating a project with the start.spring.io[Spring Initializr].

We also suggest becoming involved with the Spring community. Spring has a large and active community of developers who use it, share their ideas about how to use it to best effect, and help one another get the most from it. You can find part of the community at forum.spring.io. You can also find questions and answers at spring.io/questions (a StackOverflow page). You can find still more parts of the Spring community by searching for them with your favorite search engine.

The Spring Framework is one part of the larger Spring ecosystem {JB: ecosystem or portfolio? Juergen?}. When Spring was first created, what is now the Spring Framework was all of it. Since then, a number of other {JB: projects/modules?} have been added to Spring. You can think of the Spring Framework as the core of a group of related {JB: projects/modules?} that collectively provide all the features of Spring. You can add the other parts as needed, depending on the exact needs of your project. For example, you can integrate with several SQL and NoSQL databases, integrate with several different front end packages, choose to use one of a few messaging queues, choose to use REST (with or without HATEOAS), and so on. By letting you choose which parts to use, Spring keeps its footprint within your project to a minimum.

The Spring Framework itself is also modular, so that you can pick and choose which pieces to use. The following image shows the modules within the Spring Framework.

The Spring Framework lets you target many different platforms. The Spring Framework lets you create applications that work on the cloud, on application servers, and on devices running embedded application servers.

[NOTE]
The Spring Framework intentionally doesn't do some things, including provide help with how to deploy an application, how to manage dependencies, how to build an application, and other choices that are "beyond the code" of an application. However, Spring Boot does offer support for many of those tasks. In short, the Spring Framework focuses on letting developers create the application. Spring Boot takes things to the next level.

=== Principles of Spring

* Embrace best practices: The Spring Framework uses the best practices in software development at every opportunity, which makes it easier for you to embrace best practices in your projects, too.
* Non-invasive: The Spring Framework won't force you to adopt a particular programming style, especially if you embrace best practices.
* Flexible: Spring supports a wide variety of application servers and deployment models and always tries to be lenient with its minimal requirements for Java version and third party libraries.
* Open for customization: The Spring Framework has sane configuration defaults and tries not to be too opinionated (Spring Boot has stronger opinions), but it also provides extensions points and ways of customizing configuration that integrate nicely in your application. You can often implement interfaces and declare them as components to add new functionalities, or you can tweak the configuration without having to redefine/override everything (again, the Spring Framework is non-invasive). On that subject, the Spring Framework integrates with numerous libraries and technologies directly or provides extension points so that you can integrate with your the libraries you choose.
* Easy path to upgrade: The Spring Framework always tries to provide the smoothest possible upgrade path to the next Spring version. The Spring Framework tries to have no backwards incompatible changes and to provide early warnings about deprecations. The Spring Framework also tries to provide the smoothest possible upgrade path to the next version of Java. You can use the latest Java features with Spring, but using the latest Java version is not a hard requirement. This also shows in the Spring Framework's release management: Minor versions contain new features, while major versions are often about new features and baseline upgrades, but the Spring Framework avoids breaking or otherwise drastic changes from one version to the next.

=== Next Section

My original idea was three pieces: What is it? What does it do? How does it do it?

We've gotten a start on the first two questions. The next (probably large) chunk should answer "How does it do it?" That is, we should launch into an overview of the Spring Framework's modules, the benefits of each, which ones are required or optional, and so on.
