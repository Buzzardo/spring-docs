== Spring Framework Overview

Spring is an open source project with a large and active developer community. Spring makes the development of applications quick and easy. You can create an application in minutes. It does so by providing everything you need beyond the Java language itself. It also includes support for other members of the Java family, notably Groovy and Kotlin.

Spring supports a wide range of applications in terms of scale and longevity. You can create one-use utility programs that you store on your local computer or create cloud applications that will run for years. Spring has extensive backwards compatibility and avoids breaking changes between versions, so that a Spring application continues to run even as versions of Spring and the JDK advance.

Spring makes it easy to get started. You don't have to know everything about Spring in order to start creating a Spring application. Due to its modular nature, you can learn about only the bits and pieces you need to use.

=== What We Mean by "Spring"

The term, "Spring," means different things in different contexts. People often use it to refer to the entire Spring family of projects. Other times, they mean the Spring Framework, which is where Spring started. Still other times, they mean the Spring core container (which is one of the essential features of the Spring Framework). This document focuses on the Spring Framework.

The Spring Framework is the heart of the Spring family of projects. The other projects use the Spring Framework. The Spring Framework consists of two essential pieces: the core container and the dependency injection mechanism. It also provides a number of optional (though very often used) features: the Spring configuration model, foundational support for applications with various kinds of architectures (such as messaging applications or web applications), support for transactional data, Spring MVC (classic servlet-based web applications), and Spring Web Flux (reactive web applications).

The Spring Framework is highly modular. You can include only the modules you need. The same is true for the whole of Spring. Your project should include only the Spring projects that it needs. Every Spring application includes the Spring Framework, because the Spring Framework is the core of Spring.

=== History of Spring and the Spring Framework

Spring came into being as a response to the first Java EE specifications. The Spring Framework is the original parts of Spring. Other projects have arisen over time to add particular sets of functionality, so that Spring is now a family of projects, with the Spring Framework at its core.

The Spring Framework integrates with the following Java EE specifications.

* JPA (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338[JSR 338])
* JMS (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=914[JSR 914])
* Servlet API (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=340[JSR 340])
* WebSockets (https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356[JSR 356])
* JSON Binding API (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=367[JSR 367])
* Bean Validation (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303[JSR 303])

The Spring Framework also supports use of the Dependency Injection (https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330[JSR 330]) and Common Annotations (https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=250[JSR 250]) specifications.

Spring continues to innovate. In recent years, Spring Boot has become a widely adopted way to create a Spring application. Spring Boot offers a full-stack framework for rapid development of modern applications. Some of that speed comes from Spring Boot's way of offering an opinionated (though its opinions aren't binding) way to create an application, whether for deployment to web servers or for deployment to the cloud. In addition to Spring Boot, other Spring projects have sprung up over time, including Spring Security, Spring Data, Spring Cloud, Spring Batch, and several others. The goal of all the projects in Spring continues to be letting Java developers quickly and easily build applications.

=== Spring Principles

Spring and the Spring Framework embrace a number of core principles that have been chosen to enable rapid development of excellent applications:

* Best practices: The Spring Framework uses the best practices in software development at every opportunity, which makes it easier for you to embrace best practices in your projects, too.
* Non-invasive: The Spring Framework won't force you to adopt a particular programming style, especially if you embrace best practices.
* Flexible: Spring supports a wide variety of application servers and deployment models and always tries to be lenient with its minimal requirements for Java version and third party libraries.
* Open for customization: The Spring Framework has sane configuration defaults and tries not to be too opinionated (Spring Boot has stronger opinions), but it also provides extensions points and ways of customizing configuration that integrate nicely in your application. You can often implement interfaces and declare them as components to add new functionalities, or you can tweak the configuration without having to redefine/override everything (again, the Spring Framework is non-invasive). On that subject, the Spring Framework integrates with numerous libraries and technologies directly or provides extension points so that you can integrate with the libraries you choose.
* Easy path to upgrade: The Spring Framework always tries to provide the smoothest possible upgrade path to the next Spring version. The Spring Framework tries to have no backwards incompatible changes and to provide early warnings about deprecations. The Spring Framework also tries to provide the smoothest possible upgrade path to the next version of Java. You can use the latest Java features with Spring, but using the latest Java version is not a hard requirement. This also shows in the Spring Framework's release management: Minor versions contain new features, while major versions are often about new features and baseline upgrades, but the Spring Framework avoids breaking or otherwise drastic changes from one version to the next.

=== Spring: The Big Picture

The following image shows the major Spring projects and reveals the place of the Spring Framework within the larger family of Spring projects.

{JB: Talk about "full stack" - family of projects - mention Spring Boot} If you want to jump right in and get started, we suggest using Spring Boot and creating a project with the http://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr].

=== Spring Framework Modules

The Spring Framework itself is modular, so that you can pick and choose which pieces to use. The following image shows the modules within the Spring Framework.

The Spring Framework lets you target many different platforms. The Spring Framework lets you create applications that work on the cloud, on application servers, and on embedded application servers.

[NOTE]
The Spring Framework intentionally doesn't do some things, including provide help with how to deploy an application, how to manage dependencies, how to build an application, and other choices that are "beyond the code" of an application. However, Spring Boot does offer support for many of those tasks. In short, the Spring Framework focuses on letting developers create the application. Spring Boot takes things to the next level.
