# spring-docs

This repository is a place to put documents that I'm working on for the Spring framework. They are nearly always incomplete works in progress. Also, they are not officially blessed by or approved (or even known of) by the Spring team or any company or other entity but me. They should in no way be construed as promising or even hinting at any future functionality. They are ideas for documentation, nothing more. In short, don't read too much into these ideas.
